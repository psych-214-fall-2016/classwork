"""
This will be your new module with the Pearson correlation function

First try to fill in the "pearson_1d" function.

When you are done with "pearson_1d", you should be able to run the following
command (from the day5 directory) and see no errors or failures::

    py.test test_pearson_1d.py

Then, if you are feeling brave, fill in the "pearson_2d" function.  Test with::

    py.test test_pearson_2d.py
